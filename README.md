# Snake Game

A basic version of the snake game coded in python. 

## Start a game

Run the command :
```
python game.py
```
To control the snake, use the number pad. 
If you lose, the window will close and the score will be displayed in the console

## Set up

You can change two game settings by editing the game.py file : 
* SIZE: the size of the map (a square)
* SPEED: the speed of the snake, the faster the speed and the harder the game

## Why create an other snake game??

Learn the basics of pygmy and control manipulated libraries more easily.
This game will be used to perform automatic learning.
